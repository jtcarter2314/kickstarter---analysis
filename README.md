# kickstarter---analysis
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover data

###Overview of Project

Analyze the data for the campaign to help to find trends and to create insights within the data that could show relationships revealing new answers. These graphs can help Louise get information of the data just from a glance. Looking at the graphs can help see what relationships can be found within the data.

##Purpose

To help uncover trends and relationships with the data to help Louise find helpful hints to provide answers to a successful play behind the data.

###Analysis and Challenges

-To see if other campaigns came close to reaching their goals in the same amount of time. Two of these factors help determine this with graphs that help analyze the data.

##Analysis of Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date

- It seems that May and June would be the best time for Louise to Launch her theater project. The line chart shows a positive correlation of successful projects between the months. 

-October through December would seem to be the worst time to launch a theater project. The graph showed the biggest decline of success of projects.


###Results

##Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

- It seems from a range of Goal dollar amounts from less than $1000 to less than $4999 and greater than or equal to $35000 to less than or equal to $49999 had the most success of their outcomes reaching their goals. It would be best to try to budget around those ranges to help succeed in gaining profit.

## Challenges and difficulties Encountered

- Challenges found within analyzing the data would be calculating outcomes based on goals. Making sure that numbers of success, failed, and canceled all correlated correctly to the right goal range for each category.


##What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

- Maybe a graph with data that shows how many backers were in support of the project. This could help give another factor to consider why some projects were productive compared to others. 

- Maybe even showing different type of categories in graphs as well to show maybe people prefer a musical than a theater or etc. 

##Limitations of the dataset

- Data analyzed is only for a short amount of time (2014-2016). It would help to have more data from a recent time to help provide more accurate data. 

- If Louise could state what her entire goal of her theater project and what she is trying to do. For example, if she plans to run her Fever theater production again and to approach it a different way or what her goal for the amount of money she think it would project. 

- There could be live projects going on right now that might reveal new data that could change the data we analyzed right now.
